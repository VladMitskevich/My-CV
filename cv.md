## **About me:** 
I am getting a higher education in absentia on the 2nd year at the *ITI BSUIR* at the Faculty of Computer Technologies, specializing in industrial electronics. Also, I work in a factory as an *SMT operator* and I'm tired of it.

From the moment I got acquainted with the computer, I began to be interested in everything related to computer technology, and in particular programming. Since there was no opportunity to get an education related to programming languages in my city, I chose radio electronics. At one point, I realized that I had chosen the wrong path in life. 

After a long search for decent courses, I came across a recommendation at **RS School**.
I chose the *Frontend Development*, because I like to see the result of my work immediately, and I think,  so that factor helps me to get carried away with learning.
